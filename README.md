Milestone Project One - User Centric Frontend Development. 
I have created “The Monkees” based website with the ambition to create an effective hub for every generation of fan of the band. Providing a range of media (videos, images + audio’s) it is an ideal environment for a fan to sit back, relax and enjoy a taste of their favourite band. 
Not limited to just fans, the site dedicates an area with a booking form, for any group / individual interested in booking the band for a desired event. With a history of the band and several social links provided throughout the site to aid any individual wanting learn a little bit more about The Monkees.

UX
Understanding my specific target audience was absolutely vital when I was at the point of planning my project. I needed to ensure my user experience was perfect for each type of user, otherwise the website would simply not be a success. 
I needed to pinpoint who exactly would be interested in using the site. I found that my project primarily catered toward two specific groups of people; the casual fan, wanting to sit back and enjoy the band’s music, and individuals/groups who may be interested in booking the band for an event. The main goal for me was to make sure I created the most efficient central hub for both groups, even though each group had different goals and uses for the website. 
The most effective planning process to achieve this goal was to list multiple user stories for both groups; what they each want to achieve, how they would do this, and how to make it as easy and as quick as possible for them. From this point I had a great idea of how I wanted to project to look, and how it would all link together effectively. 
Examples of my user story list follows:

Casual Fan:
As a casual fan of ‘The Monkees’, I want to be able to listen and enjoy a catalogue of songs stress free. 
To make this goal most effective throughout the project, I knew that arriving to the specific section where a user can actually listen to music had to be as easy and as straightforward as possible. As a result of this I created a large navigation bar for larger screens and a large clickable button to access the same list on mobile and smaller devices. The list is very self explanatory and once a user clicks the ‘music’ list item, they are taken right to the top of that section, where they are provided with a couple of sentences explaining what is achievable with this section and a number of audio files and a music video to enjoy with a single mouse click. They are also provided with a clickable Youtube icon which opens the official channel in a new tab, so they can stay on the site while gaining access to a even greater collection of music. 

As a causal fan, I want to be able to view and download images of the band. 
Same as above, the user is presented with the exact same navigation options as before. To access a collection of images relating to the band, all a user has to do is simply click on the ‘Gallery’ list item provided, which quickly takes them to the top of the specific section. They are then provided with three short sentences; one of which informing the user with a single click on one of the images, they are able to directly download the desired image to their device. 

As a casual fan, I want to be able to read and learn more about the band. 
This section was of high importance for me as I believed it would be a perfect way to begin the website, and would introduce the rest of the project perfectly and provide some logical order. For this reason I placed the ‘About’ section at the top of the page, just underneath the large banner image. It is unmissable on all devices as soon as you load the website. The user is provided with 4 short paragraphs of content, with the last sentence explaining the clickable Wikipedia icon which directs the user to the official band page (which opens in a new tab). 

As a user of the web page, I want to be able to navigate around the site easily. 
This goal was of high importance for every user who may come across the project. If the website isn't easy to navigate and is complex for the user, they will simply leave. For this reason they are provided with the navigation options which are explained above. But not only that, a back to top button is placed at the bottom right of the page at all times and for all device sizes. This consists of a small box with two upwards arrows inside, making the button self explanatory for any user. With a simple click of a mouse the user is directed to the very top of the site where they are provided with the main navigation options as before. A user can simply move around each section of the website without a single scroll of a mouse or use of a sidebar. This was a great accomplishment for the project and makes the whole user experience very easy and natural for any user; whether they are very ‘techy’ or not. 

Groups/individuals interested in booking the band:
If i am interested in booking the band, I want to be able to do so easily and quickly.
Even though it is almost at the very bottom of the webpage, the booking form is potentially the most important aspect of the whole site for some users. I was easily able to create a responsive form through the bootstrap form features and grid system. Along with a few other additions, the form works as it should and can not be sent by a user if not filled out correctly. The clean and minimalist colour scheme allows the form to blend in perfectly with the rest of the site and creates a positive experience with the user. The form is very easily accessible through the navigation items and takes a user no time at all to locate on the page.

If i am interested in booking the band, I want to be able to see reviews.
It was because of this goal, that I dedicated the footer section of the website to linking the user to a range of different official social media platforms of the band. All icons open a specific social media platform within a new tab; so a user can keep the site open while reading the communities comments within the social media platforms. Not only the footer section though; at various points throughout the page a user is provided an icon linking to a specific page or social media site outside of my project. This makes popular reviews and comments very easy to find, and can be very helpful for a user carrying out research on the band. 
All mockups can be seen on the project’s Github repository, within the ‘mockup designs’ folder. You can clearly see on the smaller page designs the development of ideas (also numbered in order). The large designs represent final mockups, which can be seen as a reflection of the actual project outcome. The designs always ensured that the users goals were always kept in mind, making the site as easy to use and efficient as possible.

Features
An effective combination of features is vital to have a positive user experience for a website, and should be a very high priority for any developer looking to create a great user feel to a website.

Existing Features
Functioning navigation bar.
The navigation bar allows a user to effectively navigate to each separate section of the website with a single press of a button. Labelled navigation items make it very simple for a user to understand and make the most of this feature as soon as they see it. The smooth scrolling effect also gives this feature a great feel which improves the overall feel of the website. 

Burger Navigation Icon.
This feature transforms the wide navigation menu into a single clickable button at the top of the screen on screen sizes 767 pixels and below. This feature is great in terms of the aesthetics of the website. It reduces clutter on small screens and keeps the overall design clean and minimalist. With a single click the user can access and hide the full list of navigation items.

Back to top button.
The back to top button is a compact button placed at the bottom right of the screen at all times, which allows the user to effectively return to home at any point of the website. This feature maintains the user friendly interface, and as it is fully responsive this feature is apparent on all screen sizes. Again, the smooth scroll effect is used for this button to combat an unprofessional, jumpy feel to the site.

External linking Icons.
Throughout the site I have included a variety of icons which provides the user with an opportunity to read or watch further material of the band in a new tab.  This comes in the form of a Wikipedia page, along with a host of social media’s and even a Youtube channel. A subtle hover effect is placed on each icon which results in a slight but effective color change, resulting in a professional feel and a user friendly interface. 

Downloadable images. 
Within the Gallery section of the site a feature is in place which allows a specific image to be downloaded to the users device, with a single click on a desired image. This feature is stated at the very top of the section, along with a hover effect on each image allowing the image to jump out at you; making this feature very difficult to miss. 
Variety of functioning medias.
A variety of functioning medias are placed throughout the website and all have their own specific section. They come in the form of a music video, audio files and a range of images. The media bring the site to life, with a single click a user can stop / start and audio / video file, and all images are downloadable (as stated above). They make the website enjoyable for any user and allows the site to be a great home for any fan of the band. 

Contact form.
At the bottom of the website is a contact form which would be used by any interested group / individual who want to book the band for an event. The form provides several required fields which ensures that a user simply can’t submit a form which is not filled in correctly. With a shadow effect and a minimalist style the form looks great and maintains the overall look and design scheme of the whole website. 

Left to Implement
Forum section
A future feature of the website which is yet to be implemented is a dedication forum section for users to communicate and share thoughts. This would create a great community feel and would be a very effective addition to the website. A forum section would ensure a great user experience from start to finish.

Technologies Used
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) - https://www.w3.org/
HTML was used to create the foundation of the website. All content on the website was created with hypertext markup language. This includes text, videos, images, audio files, forms, links etc. 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html
CSS was used throughout the site to provide to page with style. From colouring to sizing and everything in between; this was possible through css. The styling was linked through an external style sheet within the text editor.  
Font Awesome - https://fontawesome.com/
Font awesome was used to gain access to a range of different icons which are used throughout the site. A perfect example of this is within the footer social media section, a selection of social media icons are used which were taken from Font Awesome. The icons used are all professional looking and give off a great impression for any user.
Google Fonts - https://fonts.google.com/
Google fonts was used to receive professional style fonts for the page. They provide a huge catalogue of fonts suitable for any style and theme. The clear example on my project would be the navigation bar font 'Spicy Rice' along with the ‘Poppins’ section header font used consistently throughout the page. 
Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
Bootstrap was used consistently within every section of the webpage. It provides a wealth of different features and components. However, my personal use of bootstrap was predominantly for the grid system they provide. It allows me to effectively position items using a row and column system. All media types such as the several images and audio files were positioned with this feature. The responsive design was made successful due to the simplicity of bootstraps features. 

Testing
Testing was an absolutely essential part of developing my project. Many small bugs were found and resolved within the testing stage, without this; a broken product would go live online. A developer can never be too careful when carrying out testing on a project, so it was vital I spent sufficient time finding and fixing errors before any files were released into public viewing. 
I ensured that the user stories (mentioned earlier in the document) were very easy and effective to carry out for any user. If a user’s goal can not be achieved easily, they would simply click off the site; resulting in a failed project. 
Listed below are the user stories and how they can be achieved by the user efficiently:
As a casual fan of ‘The Monkees’, I want to be able to listen and enjoy a catalogue of songs stress free.
Use the navigation items provided (on all device sizes) and try to select the ‘music’ option. 
Follow the instructions and try to press play on your desired piece of media. 
Try pressing on the Youtube icon - this should load within a new tab.
Once finished, try pressing the back to top button placed in the bottom right hand corner, which will direct you straight to home again.

As a causal fan, I want to be able to view and download images of the band. 
    Try pressing the ‘Gallery’ section provided in the navigation options.
    Try pressing on an image to download the correct image file.
    Try clicking the Facebook icon to reach the official Facebook page (in a new tab).
    Try pressing the back to top button to reach home.
As a casual fan, I want to be able to read and learn more about the band. 
    Try pressing the ‘about’ section of the navigation options.
    Try pressing the Wikipedia icon, this should open within a new tab.
    Try pressing the back to top button to start from home.
As a user of the web page, I want to be able to navigate around the site easily. 
    From home, try pressing any option within the navigation bar.
    When done try pressing the back to top button placed at the bottom right of the screen.
    Try following the same process with every navigation option.
If i am interested in booking the band, I want to be able to do so easily and quickly.
    Try pressing the ‘contact’ navigation option from the top of the page.
    Try submitting the form without inputting any name fields.
    Try submitting the form but leave out an email field. 
    Try submitting the form completely with the exception of a phone number.
    Try submitting without providing a date. 
If i am interested in booking the band, I want to be able to see reviews.
    Try pressing the Facebook icon within the gallery section.
    Try pressing the Youtube icon within the media section. 
    Try clicking on all 4 of the social media icons at the footer section of the web page titled ‘Social Medias’.

A major aspect of the testing process for the project was ensuring that the site looks and feels good to use on all device sizes. This was particularly difficult when it came to deciding the correct sizes for elements such as text and images. I needed to make sure the elements were large enough to read easily but also have enough room to maintain the uncluttered, clean design.
The main tool I used to help ensure the responsiveness looked and felt great on all browsers was Bootstrap grid system. In particular, the images within the project will change their position relative to the screen size. As an example, on a larger device size; the gallery section images will sit as two rows of three images. Each with enough spacing to keep a clean design, but big enough to see and appreciate each specific image. As the screen size lowers and the breakpoint is hit, the images will automatically change to a two by two setup, with some of the previous images hidden. The hidden images are to ensure a small screen is not overloaded with too much content and the user does not have to scroll unnecessarily just to get onto the next section. Finally when the last small breakpoint is hit five images will sit one by one on top of each other. Again, at all times the images will have plenty space in between to ensure the aesthetics are kept to a good standard at all times. 
This system is used throughout the project on all media types and is something I can be proud of, as every device will be able to use and see a well structured, clean looking design any user can enjoy. 
I came across several problems when testing all aspects of the project. The example in particular was the positioning of the back to top button (now placed in the bottom right corner). It was really a case of trial and error, as I did not want the button to overlap or interfere with any media on the project; especially the large video in the music section. I had to tweak the fixed positioning attributes, icon size and also div size several times. A method which proved successful for me was ‘mobile first design’. Once I finally got the settings I wanted on mobile size, it was an effective process to simply tweak the button gradually relative to the screen size increase. The back to top button is a vital feature of the project and improves user experience massively. 
 
Deployment
The deployment process of the project was a simple but methodical procedure. The first task I needed to complete was to create a new git repository within my project’s Cloud9 workspace. This was achieved by simply sending the command ‘git init’ within the workspace terminal. 
From that point, I followed a specific method which allowed me to save any new developments within the code to the repository. The method included firstly reviewing the git status to see any untracked changes which needed adding to the ‘staging area’. Once I added the specific files to the staging area and I was confident with the new development in code, I then began to commit the save to the repository using the command ‘git commit -m’ followed by a commit message. This message is used to ensure every new development in the code is unique and can be found at a later date by myself or contributors, which makes the code easy to distinguish when looking back. 
Once I reached the point within the project that I believed the site was ready to be hosted online, I needed to create a remote repository on Github. Once completed I followed the method provided by Github to push my Cloud9 repository onto my Github remote repository. 
Finally from there I hosted the project using Github’s ‘pages’ section, which I then received a link to the site when published. This is then the deployed version of the project. I can still edit my own development code which is still saved to my own private workspace. I use this to edit, upgrade, and test all areas of the project safely while the deployed version stays the same. Once I am happy with an upgrade and I want to apply these to the deployed version, all I need to do is follow the same process as before. Once the new code is pushed onto the remote repository the deployed version is then upgraded for the public to use. 

Credits
Content
The written content of my project can be found within the ‘About’ section at the top half of the site. The text was inspired from the Wikipedia source ‘https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees’, which is also linked at the bottom of the same section through a clickable Font Awesome icon. Even though the text is not simply copied and pasted, it was a great source which inspired the content of the project. 

Media
Each bit of media used within the site (except one image), were obtained through the assets file provided by The Code Institute when briefed about the project. The one exception is the large banner image (of the band sat together), placed at the top of the page. This was obtained through an advanced google image search of ‘the monkees band’, which usage rights states the image is ‘free to use, share or modify, even commercially’.

Acknowledgements
My main inspiration for the design of this website was not from a specific piece of work or creator. It was however, from a combination of wireframes and successful previous websites created and shared upon the app ‘pinterest’. They provide a huge amount of complete designs and ideas which helped me a lot throughout the planning process. Although no design was directly copied, it gave me an idea of good positioning for different screen sizes and the effectiveness of a simplistic colour scheme and layout.
